						<p>I am Aino, an aspiring software developer. I have most experience on front-end development, as I have worked with html and css in my current role. I have extended my knowledge by taking courses on Python, c#, Javascript and React, and I am hoping to work as a full-stack developer. Below you can find some projects I have made that demonstrate my current skills. </p>

						<h2>My Story</h2>
						<p>Want to know where it all started? The year was 2015 and I was doing computer science in elementary school. All students were supposed to create one Scratch coding project that would utilize one basic coding mechanic. However, I found this idea a bit boring and wanted to do something more. A day later, I posted &quot;The makkara game&quot; (the sausage game), which combined my humour with my passion for ice hockey. The project got praise from all my peers, and I got full marks on the course.</p>
						<p>After that, I attended the IB program for high school (it had the nickname &quot;killer high school&quot;), and I also stopped coding. I wanted to study psychology but got into business school with my diploma. During university, I decided to take coding classes, since they challenged me more than other courses, and I was able to be more creative. I loved the challenges and the feeling after solving complex issues. If there was a concept that I didn't understand, I practiced until I understood it fully.</p>
						<p>And now here I am, recently graduated from University but still wanting to do more and more coding. Because of my passion I have been able to use HTML and CSS at my current position at work, but I want to take my skills further and get more into Full-end instead of purely front-end. My philosophy still is to grind the concepts I feel are most challenging, until I master them.</p>
						<p>Read until here? As a reward, I can reveal that my first ever coding project is still online! Feel free to play it through <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/62817342/">here</a>!</p>
